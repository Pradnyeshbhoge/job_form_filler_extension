## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working?
1. Check if extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`
2. Refresh the page you're trying to use it on
3. Check browser console for any error messages
4. Ensure the page has actual `<form>` elements

### "Could not establish connection" Error?
This error typically occurs when:
1. **Extension not loaded**: Make sure the extension is properly loaded in Chrome
2. **Wrong page type**: The extension only works on web pages (http/https), not on Chrome's internal pages
3. **Content script blocked**: Some sites may block content scripts
4. **Extension permissions**: Ensure all permissions are granted

**Solution**: 
- Try refreshing the page
- Make sure you're on a regular website (not chrome://, about:, etc.)
- Check the extension is enabled and has proper permissions

### Forms Not Detected?
- Some sites use custom form implementations
- Try refreshing the page
- Check if the site uses JavaScript to load forms dynamically

### Auto-fill Not Working?
1. Verify your profile data is saved
2. Check if form fields have proper names/IDs
3. Try manually triggering with keyboard shortcut
4. Some sites may block content scripts

## 🚀 Advanced Features

### Custom Field Mapping

- Use common field names in your profile
- Match placeholder text patterns
- Ensure labels are descriptive

### SPA Support
- Automatically detects URL changes
- Monitors for dynamic content updates
- Works with React, Vue, Angular, and other frameworks

### Cross-Device Sync
